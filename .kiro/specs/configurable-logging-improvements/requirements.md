# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for implementing a configurable logging system that allows end users to control logging behavior for both the GSPy DLL and their Python scripts through JSON configuration. The system will provide unified logging with configurable verbosity levels, performance optimization options, and seamless integration between C++ and Python logging.

## Glossary

- **GSPy_Logger**: The configurable logging system for the GSPy DLL
- **Configuration_Manager**: Component that reads and applies logging settings from JSON configuration
- **Unified_Log_System**: Combined logging mechanism serving both DLL and Python script logging
- **Log_Level_Controller**: Component managing verbosity levels (0=ERROR, 1=WARNING, 2=INFO, 3=DEBUG)
- **Python_Log_Bridge**: Interface allowing Python scripts to write to the unified log through gspy.log()
- **Performance_Optimizer**: Component that minimizes logging overhead based on configuration

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to configure logging verbosity through my JSON configuration file, so that I can control the amount of logging detail and optimize performance for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL read log_level setting from JSON configuration file
2. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL support log_level values 0 (ERROR), 1 (WARNING), 2 (INFO), and 3 (DEBUG)
3. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL use log_level 2 (INFO) as default when not specified
4. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL apply the configured log level to both DLL and Python script logging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a production user, I want to minimize logging overhead for performance-critical simulations, so that I can achieve optimal simulation speed while retaining error reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log_level is set to 0, THE Performance_Optimizer SHALL eliminate 90-95% of log writes
2. THE Performance_Optimizer SHALL preserve all ERROR level messages regardless of performance settings
3. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL provide fast-path filtering to minimize overhead when logging is disabled
4. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL maintain thread safety during high-performance logging operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Python script developer, I want to write custom log messages from my Python code, so that all logging from both the DLL and my script appears in a unified log file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Python_Log_Bridge SHALL provide gspy.log(message, level) function in Python scripts
2. THE Python_Log_Bridge SHALL support log levels 0 (ERROR), 1 (WARNING), 2 (INFO), and 3 (DEBUG)
3. THE Python_Log_Bridge SHALL use level 2 (INFO) as default when level parameter is omitted
4. THE Python_Log_Bridge SHALL write Python log messages to the same log file as DLL messages
5. THE Python_Log_Bridge SHALL respect the configured log_level setting from JSON configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent and predictable log file creation, so that I can easily locate and review log files for troubleshooting and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL create log files using the DLL/config file name with "_log.txt" suffix
2. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL place log files in the same directory as the JSON configuration file
3. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL initialize logging early before any subsystem operations
4. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL create a single log file per session without rotation in Phase 1
5. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL maintain the current naming convention for backward compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want appropriate categorization of log messages, so that I can focus on relevant information and reduce log noise during development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL classify verbose per-element operations as DEBUG level messages
2. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL classify data marshalling details as DEBUG level messages  
3. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL classify initialization checks as DEBUG level messages
4. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL maintain lifecycle errors and success messages as INFO level
5. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL ensure critical system events remain visible at appropriate levels

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want reliable logging that gracefully handles failures, so that diagnostic information remains available even when file system issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF log file creation fails, THEN THE GSPy_Logger SHALL write a warning to stderr
2. IF log file creation fails, THEN THE GSPy_Logger SHALL redirect all subsequent logging to stderr
3. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL NOT throw exceptions during logging operations
4. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL ensure logging functionality continues despite file system errors
5. THE GSPy_Logger SHALL maintain thread safety during fallback operations
